Project Turnstile
======
Turnstile is a paper-to-digital counting system that takes paper sign-in sheets as input, then outputs an Excel document of detailed sign-in information. This information includes the number of residents who visited the Depot service center, the type of resident, and whether they are members of the Homeless Veterans Reintegration Program. Turnstile ignores fields for time in, time out, and purpose of visit.
Turnstile categorizes the data by day and by month. The system outputs a new Excel spreadsheet each time it is run. Further, it will immediately display errors, such as missing resident type or multi-typed input, providing the location within the document so that employees can find and correct them.
